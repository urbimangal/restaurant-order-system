# Restaurant Order System

## Description
Restaurant Order System is a C++ based console application developed to simulate basic restaurant operations. The system allows users to view a menu, place customer orders, calculate bills, and generate order receipts. It is designed using object-oriented programming principles to represent real-world entities such as dishes, orders, and order items.

## Features
- Display restaurant menu with dish details
- Place customer orders with quantity selection
- Calculate total bill amount automatically
- Generate order receipts
- View previously placed orders
- Supports dine-in and takeaway orders

## Technologies Used
- C++
- STL (vector)
- Object-Oriented Programming

## Purpose
This project was built as part of academic learning to strengthen understanding of C++ fundamentals, object-oriented design, and logical problem-solving through a real-world application.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/urbimangal/restaurant-order-system

2. Compile the program  
   g++ main.cpp -o restaurant_system

3. Run the application  
   ./restaurant_system

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of classes and objects
- Practical use of STL containers
- Better grasp of program flow and data modeling
- Experience in building console-based applications

## Future Improvements
- File handling for storing order history
- Enhanced input validation
- Simple GUI or web-based interface
